        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <img src="coffee-shop.jpg" alt="Coffee Brew Shop" class="about-img">
        <p>At Coffee Brew, we believe that a great cup of coffee is not just about the beans; it's about the experience, the atmosphere, and the people you share it with. Since opening our doors, we've been committed to providing our customers with the highest quality coffee, brewed fresh every day with care and precision.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2020, Coffee Brew began as a small, cozy space where coffee lovers could escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Our goal is to create a community-centered café that fosters connections, creativity, and of course, serves the best coffee in town.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is simple: to bring people together over delicious coffee. We source our beans from sustainable farms and work closely with local roasters to ensure each cup we serve is fresh, rich, and full of flavor. At Coffee Brew, every sip is a step toward a better tomorrow—because great coffee should be enjoyed responsibly.</p>
